Eigenvalue Analysis of Undamped Spring–Mass System:
Overview:

This project analyzes a coupled spring–mass system using matrix methods and eigenvalue analysis in MATLAB. The system is modeled as an ideal undamped mechanical system to study how mass distribution affects displacement response under an applied force.

The objective is to determine how each mass behaves spatially rather than temporally — specifically, how displacement amplitude varies with mass.

Methodology:
System equations derived using Newton’s Second Law.
Matrix form representation of multi-DOF system.
Eigenvalues and eigenvectors computed in MATLAB.
Displacement amplitudes plotted against masses.
Visualization used to interpret relative motion of masses.

Results:

Distribution of displacement across masses.
Relative stiffness influence on motion.
